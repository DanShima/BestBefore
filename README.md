# BestBefore
- This is a hackathon project done during the weekend of 20-21 October 2018.
- The main idea is to fight food waste from your fridge.

# Future development
- Able to restart a challenge
- See statistics “This week you threw 1 kg food less than last week, this means that you have reduced the carbon dioxide emission with 2 kg!”
- Filter: sort by date or categories or sort challenges by difficulty
- Camera: use TensorFlow to identify food
- Scan QR code/barcodes/receipts
- Suggest Recipes and New Products to Buy
- Challenge Friends!
- Share Challenges to Social Media
